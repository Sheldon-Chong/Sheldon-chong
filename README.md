### üéÆ Games
I've been developing video games throughout the past 8 years. I combine my coding skills with my digital art skills and creative ideas into these videogames. I participated in international and local coding and game development competitions and have won top spots.

### üîç Articles & Insights 
I have written several extensive articles regarding, compiling knowledge I have gathered via research

A few months ago, I wrote myself some notes on Netpractice as I was doing research on the subject. However as my knowledge grew, so did the rabbit-hole that was networking. There were a lot of great resources out there, but I didn't find source that effectively provided the entire picture for networking. Compiling my findings, I spent 2-weeks refining this guide.

This guide aims to give a full picture on the subjects concerning netpractice from scratch, in a manner as digestible as I could make it. Many points brought up will be supported by graphics and visuals that I illustrated. 

It covers netpractice topics such as IP addresses, CIDR and subnet calculations, and Networking devices, plus additional concepts such as ARP requests, MAC addresses, DNS and DHCP.
