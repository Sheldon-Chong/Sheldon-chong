## Hi there, I'm Sheldon Chong üëã

### About me
- Technical Lead and Artist at CyberLegends Animations, reaching 1.3M subscribers across <a href="">YouTube (900K)</a>, <a href="">Bilibili (375K)</a>, and¬†<a href="">TikTok (21K) </a>.
- üé® Coder, Digital Artist, YouTuber, Animator, Entrepreneur, and Speaker.
- üõ†Ô∏è I develop tools to streamline animation production, enhancing efficiency while maintaining artistic quality.
- ü§ñ I‚Äôm passionate about automating workflows to free up more time for creativity¬†and¬†innovation.
- üé§ I‚Äôve shared my expertise through talks and workshops relating to 2D animation, YouTube, and coding, for the past 9 years

Together with my younger brother, I co-manage CyberLegends Animations, a YouTube channel with over 900K subscribers and 179 million views

	<br>As at 6.3.2025 
</p>

Besides doing animation, illustration, and scriptwriting, I spearhead automation and software scripting using my skills in coding. Below are some of the projects I've worked on:
- **Multi-lingual translation:** Our animations, which are in english, are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Brazillian, utilizing a software I developed to translate, relink and generate visual dialogues for characters in the animation.
- **Video-editing post-production:** Utilizing Davinci Resolve's scripting API, I have coded tools to help with importing, aligning and adjusting clips inside its video-editor.
- **Animation tools** Utilizing QT script and Action Script, I have coded scripts that help with speeding up certain processes during the creation of animations

## üîç Articles & insights I have written 
I have written several extensive articles regarding, compiling knowledge I have gathered via research and projects that I have worked on. As I'm passionate about graphic design and illustration, these guides are equipped with as much visual aids to assist with navigating difficult concepts.

		<td>
A few months ago, I wrote some notes while studying Netpractice, a project of the 42 Core program. However as my knowledge grew, so did the rabbit-hole that was networking. Lot of great learning resources existed, but I didn't find source that effectively provided the entire picture for networking. Compiling my findings, I created this guide. It aims to give a full picture on networks from scratch, in a manner as digestible as I could make it. Many points brought up will be supported by graphics and visuals that I illustrated. 

<i>Topics include: IP addresses, CIDR and subnet calculations, and networking devices, plus additional concepts such as ARP requests, MAC addresses, DNS and DHCP.</i>

    		<td>
I spent several months developing a 2D isometric scroller game, using an extremely bare-bones graphics library in a low-level-language - C. This article aims to cover aspects of the game's development, and how I approached each one. 

<i>Topics include: how I applied Isometric rendering and asset-creation, 2D animation utilizing a hybrid method of interpolation, dynamic camera that follows the player, and enemy AI using ray-casting.</i>

    		<td>
(Coming soon) This article is an extension of the Networks article I wrote earlier. It aims to expand previously covered concepts, such as Clients and IP addresses, but will dive deeper into the weeds that is exactly how data is sent and retrieved, between clients and a webserver. It utilizes the same example-based, step-by-step learning method to explain concepts

<i>Topics include: Ports, sockets, request methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, how webserver's process data using CGI, multi-part/form data</i>
