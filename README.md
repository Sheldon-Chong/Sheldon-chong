## Hi there, I'm Sheldon Chong 👋
### 😁 About me
My name is Sheldon Chong and I'm 15 years old. I enjoy pursuing my passion in drawing and digital art, writing fiction story books, coding, music, and entrepreneurship. Drawing is something I've been doing since I was 2 years old and it has evolved into digital art and animations. I use my art skills to design brochures, apps, games. I also enjoy writing fictional storybooks and I have already published 2 of these books. My younger brother and I manage a YouTube Channel called CyberLegends Animations, which currently has amassed a 130k subscribers and over 43 million views.

### 🎮 Games
I've been developing video games for the past 6 years. When creating these video games, I combine my coding skills with my digital art skills and creative ideas. I participated in international and local coding and game development competitions and have won top spots.
