### Hi there, I'm Sheldon Chong ðŸ‘‹
Hello my name is Sheldon. I enjoy developing videogames and have been doing so the since 2015. 

### About me
I'm 15 years old. I enjoy pursuing my passion in art and digital art, writing fictional story books, coding, music, and entrepreneurship. Drawing is something I've been doing since I was 2 years old and it has evolved into digital art. I use my art skills to design brochures, apps, games. I also enjoy writing fictional storybooks and I have already published 2 of these books. My younger brother and I manage a Youtube Channel called Cyberle

### Games
I've been developing videogames for the past 6 years, since 2015. When creating these videogames, I combine my coding skills with my digital art skills and creative ideas.
