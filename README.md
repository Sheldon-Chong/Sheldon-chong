## Hi there, I'm Sheldon Chong 👋

- Tech lead to Software Developer, Workflow Engineer and Animator at CyberLegends Animations, reaching 1.3M subscribers across <a href="">YouTube (900K)</a>, <a href="">Bilibili (375K)</a>, and <a href="">TikTok (21K) </a>.
- 🎨 Coder, Digital Artist, YouTuber, Animator, Entrepreneur, and Speaker.
- 🛠️ I develop tools to streamline animation production, enhancing efficiency while maintaining artistic quality.
- 🤖 I’m passionate about automating workflows to free up more time for creativity and innovation.
- 🎤 I’ve shared my expertise through talks and workshops relating to 2D animation, YouTube, and coding, for the past 9 years

Together with my younger brother, I co-manage CyberLegends Animations, a YouTube channel with over 900K subscribers and 179 million views. It has gained a following on other platforms such as BiliBili and TikTok

	<br>As at 6.3.2025 
</p>

Besides doing animation, illustration, and scriptwriting, I spearhead automation and software scripting using my skills in coding. Below are some of the tools I've developed:
- **Multi-lingual translation:** Our animations, which are in english, are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Brazillian, utilizing a software I developed to translate, relink and generate visual dialogues for characters in the animation.
- **Video-editing post-production:** Utilizing Davinci Resolve's scripting API, I have coded tools to help with importing, aligning and adjusting clips inside its video-editor.
- **Animation tools:** Utilizing QT Script and Action Script, I have coded scripts that help with speeding up certain processes during the creation of animations

## 🔍 My articles & insights 

I’ve written in-depth articles sharing insights from my research and projects. As I'm passionate about graphic design and illustration, I include many visual aids in these articles to simplify complex concepts.

		A few months ago, I wrote some notes while studying Netpractice, a project of the 42 Core program. However as my knowledge grew, so did the rabbit-hole that was networking. I created this article that provides the full picture on computer networks in a digestible-as-possible manner, from the perspective of someone who started with zero knowledge.
		<br><br>
		💡 Topics include: IP addresses, CIDR and subnet calculations, network hardware, ARP requests, MAC addresses, DNS and DHCP.

		I spent several months developing a 2D isometric scroller game, using an extremely bare-bones graphics library in a low-level-language - C. This article aims to cover aspects of the game's development, and how I approached each one. 
		<br><br>
		💡 Topics include: Applying isometric rendering and asset-creation, 2D animation using interpolation, dynamic camera that tracks player, enemy AI via ray-casting

		(Coming soon) This article is an extension of the Networks article I wrote earlier. It aims to expand previously covered concepts, such as Clients and IP addresses, but will dive deeper into the weeds that is exactly how data is sent and retrieved, between clients and a webserver. It utilizes the same example-based, step-by-step learning method to explain concepts
		<br><br>
		💡 Topics include: Ports, sockets, request methods, how webserver's process data using CGI, multi-part/form data
